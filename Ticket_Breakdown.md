# Ticket Breakdown
We are a staffing company whose primary purpose is to book Agents at Shifts posted by Facilities on our platform. We're working on a new feature which will generate reports for our client Facilities containing info on how many hours each Agent worked in a given quarter by summing up every Shift they worked. Currently, this is how the process works:

- Data is saved in the database in the Facilities, Agents, and Shifts tables
- A function `getShiftsByFacility` is called with the Facility's id, returning all Shifts worked that quarter, including some metadata about the Agent assigned to each
- A function `generateReport` is then called with the list of Shifts. It converts them into a PDF which can be submitted by the Facility for compliance.

## You've been asked to work on a ticket. It reads:

**Currently, the id of each Agent on the reports we generate is their internal database id. We'd like to add the ability for Facilities to save their own custom ids for each Agent they work with and use that id when generating reports for them.**


Based on the information given, break this ticket down into 2-5 individual tickets to perform. Provide as much detail for each ticket as you can, including acceptance criteria, time/effort estimates, and implementation details. Feel free to make informed guesses about any unknown details - you can't guess "wrong".


You will be graded on the level of detail in each ticket, the clarity of the execution plan within and between tickets, and the intelligibility of your language. You don't need to be a native English speaker, but please proof-read your work.

## Your Breakdown Here

1. 
  *Title*: Create `FacilityAgents` table
  *Description*: 
    We need to create a new table with the relation `many-to-many` for `Agents` and `Facilities`. It should contain next columns:
      - `internal_agent_id`
      - `uuid`
      - `readable_id` - is optional, if we still need to force our clients to enter some readable ids
      - `facility_id`
    We also need to create a migration that will assamble the table from existing `Facilities` and `Agents` tables.
    In the scope of this task, we also need to create a migration, that will replace the inner id of the agent in `Shifts` table on the specific agent id per facility.
    For the testing environment, we need to create seed entries, for testing purposes.
  *Acceptance criteria*:
    - created table
    - created migration for it
    - created seeds
  *Estimate*:
    2-3 SP
  *Implementation details*:
    The assumption is that `uuid` will be automatically generated by DB, it will allow us not to handle the logic of validation for duplicates. Our clients don't need to spend time on such low-level tasks, we can do it automatically.

2. 
  *Title*: Discuss contracts with FE team
  *Description*: 
    Setup a meeting with FE team and discuss contracts
  *Acceptance criteria*:
    A draft document of contracts between FE and BE
  *Estimate*:
    1-2 SP
  *Implementation details*:
    This step allows us to parallelize the work of FE and BE. Both teams can work separately, but based on the accepted agreements. This step can be ommited if we don't have short TTM

3.  
  *Title*: Create a new function for getting aggent shifts per facility
  *Description*:
    Create a function `getAgentByCustomID`. This function should take custom id `uuid` (or `readable_id`) from `FacilityAgents` table and make a request to DB with a join query to `FacilityAgents`, `Agents`, and `Shifts`. It should allow us to take a selection that will contain such data as `Shift` entry, and info about an agent.
  *Acceptance criteria*:
    We can get all shifts of agent based on its' custom id defined per facility
  *Estimate*: 2-3 SP
  *Implementation details*:
    Since we probably need to have backward compatibility, it would be nice to create a new function, but not make breaking changes to the existing one. Also for creating reports we need only the data about agents and shifts since such reports will be generated for the particular facility (assumption).
  
4. 
  *Title*: unit tests
  *Description*:
    Cover `getAgentByCustomID` with unit tests.
  *Acceptance criteria*:
    Existing unit tests with covering 95% of the codebase.
  *Estimate*: 1-2 SP
  *Implementation details*:
    Nothing special, just need to cover the function with unit tests.

5. 
  *Title*: Create endpoints
  *Description*:
    Create endpoints for getting reports. This endpoint should operate by two functions: 
      - `getAgentByCustomID`
      - `generateReport`
    And based on this information it should return a generated report per agent(assumption):
  *Acceptance criteria*:
    FE can interact with endpoint and generate needed reports
  *Estimate*: 1-2 SP
  *Implementation details*:
    The name of the endpoint should be taken from earlier discussed contracts.
